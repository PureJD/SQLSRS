### This is a spaced repetition system that interacts with an SQL database and allows the user to enter questions for later review.

### - In the program the user fills the database with questions and the program returns the questions at a later data for the user to review. This is a simple version of the program and it can later be made much more complex by adding user profiles, the option to delete database entries and more complex algorithms to categorise entries frequency in relation to the amount of successful answers provided by the user.
